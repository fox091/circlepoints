# circlepoints
Provides some functions to generate evenly distributed points pseudo-randomly in a circle using a few different techniques.

Heavily inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y_nmpv-9lI.

I wanted to determine the performance of some of these methods using Go and came to the same conclusion that the lame rejection method is the fastest.
